# Heartfelt

A simple Rust library for creating DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)

## Roadmap
This is still pretty much a work in progress. There will soon be an update with 
examples and documentation.

Heartfelt is still at a very early stage but a lot of features are planned.
For Instance: 
A compiler to bytecode.
A vm for that bytecode.
More language features.

Most of the features will be behind a cargo feature in order to keep binary sizes as small as
possible and to only feature what you really need.
