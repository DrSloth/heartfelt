#NOTE - This currently is only a quick hack for easy config (DSL)

#TODO - Heartfelt 0.1
    #DONE - A simple Runtime
    #DONE - Data
        #DONE - String
        #DONE - Int
        #DONE - Bool
        #DONE - Float
        #DONE - Character
    #DONE - Extensible with own instructions
    #DONE - Labels
    #DONE - Goto Instructions
    Single threaded only
    unsafe allowed but relatively safe

#TODO - Heartfelt 0.1.1
    #TODO - Clean Code a little
    #TODO - A little bit of documentation

#TODO - Heartfelt 0.2
    #TODO - Variables
    #TODO - Heartfelt Instructions
    #TODO - Inlined instructions (inst)
    #TODO - A little Optimisation
    #TODO - Extensible types
    #TODO - Better error handling
    #TODO - Array
    #TODO - Modules (?)
    #TODO - Variable instructions (a way of saving instructions in variables (@inst) ?)
        The instructions could be continuously looked up and then it could be on demand
        that would be the easier solution (in general speed is nothing with high prio)
        but the runtime would need to be changed (in general not the best idea) 
    Single threaded only
    deny_unsafe ? (if possible) (multiple runtimes?)

#TODO - Heartfelt 1.0
    #TODO - Macros
    #TODO - Threading
    #TODO - Optimisation
    #TODO - Ready for release
